              Odessa was established in 1794 by the Empress Catherine the Great
              on land conquered from the Ottoman Empire on the site of the Black
              Sea fortress town of Khadzhibei. Catherine sent notices throughout
              Europe offering migrants land, tax exemptions, and religious
              freedom, attracting migrants of all types.

        Thanks to its status until 1859 as a porto franco —a free port, exempt
        from taxes—Odessa attracted wealthy foreign merchants and
        exporters.Odessa was multinational, multilingual, and multiethnic, which
        was reflected in its cafés.

        “There is perhaps no town in the world in which so many different
        tongues may be heard as in the streets and coffeehouses of Odessa, the
        motley population consisting of Russians, Tartars, Greeks, Jews, Poles,
        Italians, Germans, French, etc.”​

              Politically and culturally, toward the middle of the nineteenth
              century, Odessa became a center of Jewish life and attracted many
              maskilim: proponents of the Haskalah, the Jewish Enlightenment
              that began to take hold in eastern European cities and towns. In
              the 1860s, Odessa was the empire’s center for the publication of
              multilingual Jewish periodicals. Rassvet, Sion, and Den appeared
              in Russian-language editions between 1860 and 1871, as did
              Ha-melits in Hebrew and Kol mevaser in Yiddish in the same period.
              By the late 1860s, major Jewish book publishers opened branches in
              Odessa, promoting, among other publications, books of the Haskalah
              movement. This freedom of Jewish life and intellectual creativity
              in the city of Odessa was crystallized around the idea of the
              Odessa café as a center of Jewish culture and a place where Jews
              “felt absolutely at home.” In a published letter from November 2,
              1861, Z., a traveler from Vilna (Vilnius, Lithuania), wrote about
              his experience in Odessa, which he called “the capital of Jews”
            </p>
            <p class="vl fst-italic">
              “In the days after I returned from Odessa, I hastened to relate to
              you, the impressions I had. . . . I won’t tell you about the
              beauty, the princely life, the freedom and the wealth, which is
              already more or less familiar to all; I will tell only that I, at
              least, have never seen a comparable city. . . . But all this is of
              secondary importance for Jews, as there are many beautiful cities
              in the empire. I want to dwell only on the situation of our
              coreligionists there.” ​

      <h2>Revolution and Crime in the "City of Life"</h2>
      <p class="porto-franco">
        After the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881, there were waves
        of anti-Jewish violence in the Russian Empire including Odessa.
        Anti-Semitism and political tension in Odessa and its cafés only
        increased in 1905 in the wake of the abortive Russian Revolution against
        the tsarist regime, sparking a large pogrom in which at least four
        hundred Jews and one hundred non-Jews were killed and approximately
        three hundred people, mostly Jews, were injured. Nonetheless, Odessa and
        its cafés continued to be central to Jewish culture, which in the early
        twentieth century became linked to Odessa's mythologized image as a
        “city of rogues and gangsters.” The complicated identity of Odessa
        during this time—an exchange between the image of a criminal Odessa and
        that of middle-class respectability—was expressed in a feuilleton penned
        in June 1913 by Leri, one of Odesskiy listok’s journalists, concerning
        Odessa’s popular cafés:
      </p>
      <p class="vertical porto-franco fst-italic">
        “It is always the way in Odessa. First, the tasteless smoke-filled
        mansions of Robina, Libman. . . . a cup of coffee, and business
        conversation; then, an assault and battery, breach of the public peace;
        then, the bleak chamber of the justice of the peace. And the next day
        small synopses printed in the newspapers. Such are our ways, a kind of
        Odessan fun-house mirror.”
      </p>
      <h2>World War I and Sovietization</h2>
      <p class="porto-franco">
        During World War I, Odessa was far from major battlefields and majorly
        unperturbed. Ya’akov Fichman, a Hebrew poet who lived in Odessa during
        the first years of the 1900s, came back to the city in 1915 and observed
        that Odessa during the Great War was “calmer and quieter than the day it
        was established”:
      </p>
      <p class="vertical porto-franco fst-italic">
        “The deserted port seemed as if it stretched to the eastern horizon. . .
        . The city itself was full of life. The cafés were full of people. . . .
        The War years—I am afraid to say—were the most carefree years in our
        life.”

          <div class="col paragraph-history">
            <p>
              As a consequence of the 1917 October Revolution and the
              consolidation of Soviet control in Odessa, Jewish schools,
              synagogues, and other religious groups, including nearly all
              non-Bolshevik cultural institutions, were closed.

      <p class="porto-franco">
        Nonetheless, during this chaotic time, Jewish café culture and
        creativity did not cease to exist. A group of Jewish Odessan writers,
        including Isaac Babel , continued to meet in private apartments and
        cafés. Babel wrote about the humor of Odessa that developed in the
        city’s cafés, as well as the characters he saw and met in them—from
        Benya Krik, the Jewish gangster, to middle-class merchants, aspiring
        writers, fashionable women, and cross-dressers—who constantly traversed
        the social and cultural borders. In 1918, Babel published in Petrograd’s
        newspaper two feuilletons with the title Listki ob Odesse (Odessa
        dispatches), in which he describes Odessa in the period of the 1917
        revolution and civil war. Babel describes the “aroma” of Odessa as a
        strange one, which can be best noticed in the cafés and in Odessa’s
        newspapers and magazines such as the Divertissement (published 1907–
        1918).
      </p>
      <h2>World War II and the Aftermath</h2>
      <p class="porto-franco">
        Following a siege lasting two months, on 17 October 1941 the Romanians
        and Germans occupied Odessa, which was officially declared part of
        Romanian Transnistria. Jews were immediately registered separately, with
        some 8,000 slaughtered during the few first days. Many Jews had fled the
        city during the siege; there were between 80,000 and 90,000 Jews
        residing there at the time it was invaded. By war’s end, only 5,000
        remained alive. (YIVO) Soviet troops recaptured the city on 10 April
        1944. Statistics on the city’s immediate postwar population are
        imprecise, but as many as 180,000 Jews were living in Odessa as of the
        late 1950s, the vast majority of them recent arrivals. Postwar Soviet
        Odessa was marked by blatant antisemitism and anti-Jewish persecution,
        along with the closing down of all Yiddish institutions and the arrest
        of Yiddish cultural activists. Emil Draitser described his childhood
        experience in the postwar Soviet Union in Shush! Growing Up Jewish under
        Stalin:
      </p>
      <p class="vertical porto-franco fst-italic">
        “There's no hope of escape. No matter where I run, I am branded.
        "Without kin," "Unscrupulous," "Rootless." [...] Since everyone avoids
        using the word Jew, the feeling that I belong to a strange, ill-defined
        ethnicity takes roots in me and lasts for a long time [...] A people
        like a curse.”
      </p>
      <p class="main-paragraph porto-franco">
        Although the golden age of cafés is over, the mythological 'Jewish City'
        continues to inspire fiction about its Jewish life and rich past, much
        of it inseparable from the cafés that embodied both the blessing and the
        curse of the modern city of Odessa.
      </p>
      <h2>The Humor Capital</h2>
      <p class="porto-franco">
        Throughout the former Soviet Union, Odessa is considered the capital of
        humor. It’s unclear exactly how this came to be, but most people who
        have encountered Odessa locals will note their cheerful nature and
        original sense of humor. Perhaps it is the southern temperament, or the
        motley national mix of this city in which Ukrainians, Russians, Jews,
        Moldavians, Greeks, Armenians and Georgians live alongside each other.
        This melting pot environment is what created a specific Odessan
        subculture, with its own slang and a uniquely ironic worldview. Staples
        of Odessa humor are aphorisms from the Odessan Privoz market, elements
        from Jewish culture, a unique jargon and conversational style. Odessa
        has given the world a great number of talented humorists: writers and
        screenwriters, actors and showmen.
      </p>
      <h2 class="porto-franco">A Small Tragedy of Odessa Humor</h2>
      <p class="porto-franco">
        Ordinary Odessites usually don’t flaunt their sense of humor, since for
        them it is simply a part of daily life and conversation. However,
        outside the city limits, Odessa’s unique sense of humor enjoys wide
        popularity. This results in a small tragedy for the ordinary Odessite –
        if he leaves Odessa and ends up in mixed company, everyone seems to
        believe that meeting an Odessa citizen is a free ticket to an evening
        comedy. The Odessite is festively sat down on a chair, people gather
        around and wait for him to deliver a joke – regardless of whether he
        wants to, or even if he considers himself a funny person. In this way,
        the city’s glory sometimes plays a mean joke on its residents. Of
        course, there are also Odessites who embrace this and turn comedy into
        their profession – usually, Odessan youth with a comic leaning starts by
        participating in the KVN games.
