            <h2>Opera and Ballet House</h2>
            <p>
              Opera and Ballet House Odessa Opera and Ballet House is among
              Ukraine’s greatest architectural monuments and is one of the most
              beautiful theaters in the world. The theatre has an Italian
              baroque facade, with a Renaissance–style entrance and stone
              figures depicting scenes from Aristophanes and Euripides. There
              are also allegorical stone sculptures of the Goddess of Tragedy,
              in a chariot drawn by four panthers; Orpheus, charming the centaur
              with his music; cherubs playing, singing and dancing teaching a
              young girl; there are busts of Pushkin, Gogol, Griboyedov and
              Glinka, representing poetry, comedy, drama and music. The
              auditorium is in the style of Louis XVI, with a chandelier that
              weights almost two and a half tons, surrounded on the ceiling by
              frescoes depicting scenes from Twelfth Night, A Midsummer Night’s
              Dream, A Winter’s Tale and As You Like It. The architects,
              remembering a fire in a Viennese theater, provided the foyer with
              twenty four exits. We strongly recommend every visitor take a tour
              or visit a show at this magnificent structure.

              After the opera house, take a stroll towards Potemkin Steps, but
              prior to taking a walk down towards the port note the central
              statue of Duke Richelieu, the first governor of Odessa. Visiting
              Russia in 1795, Richelieu was appointed lieutenant colonel of the
              Cuirassiers of St. George, and later Tsar Alexander I appointed
              him governor of Odessa and governor general of New Russia, the
              area between the Dniester River and the Caucasus. After cleaning
              up a corrupt administration, Richelieu transformed the Black Sea
              village of Odessa into a modern city. He constructed port
              facilities and encouraged agriculture and commerce.

            <h2>Potemkin Steps</h2>
            <p>
              After a Kodak moment with Duke, take a stroll towards Potemkin
              Steps; the legendary staircase which saw a 1905 battle between
              mutinying sailors and forces loyal to the Czar. The clash was
              immortalized in Eisenstein’s 1925 silent film, “Battleship
              Potemkin.” Some obscure facts about the steps as a structure is
              the fact that you can't see the steps at all when standing atop -
              all you can see are a few landings. However, when you stand below
              the steps, all you can see are the steps. It is an optical
              illusion. The steps took four years to build and were completed in
              1841. Take a stroll down the steps and venture across the street
              to the long pier to catch a boat cruise, or hike back up for the
              best workout around.

              bring you to a historic building which is currently Odessa’s City
              Hall. It is located in front of a monument to Alexander Pushkin,
              which is considered by many to be Russia’s greatest poet. Pushkin

            <h2>Monuments and Statutes</h2>
            <p>
              Not a single city in Ukraine and in all likelihood in all of the
              former USSR can boast of such an abundance of monuments, memorial
              plaques, and other “street furniture” per capita as can Odessa.
              While the best way to see these is to aimlessly wonder around the
              city, a few are of greater fame and importance and thus are worth
              pointing out. First one is a monument of Leonid Utesov, a famous
              Odessa jazz singer and songwriter. Eternally he sits on a bench
              located directly next to Gorsad ( City Garden) on Deribasovskaya
              Street. Another interesting exhibit is located directly behind the
              Port terminal, adjacent to the marina. Here, you won't be able to
              miss this charming sculpture of bronze to the rounded shapes under
              the name “The Golden Child” by sculptor Ernst Neizvestny.

            <h2>Park Shevchenko</h2>
            <p>
              After you are finished with Deribasovkaya Street (which can take
              awhile) and monument hunting, you can either stroll or take a cab
              to Park Shevchenko. Walking would take approximately 15 minutes
              while a cab ride will get you there in less than 5 minutes. The
              park is home to World War II Memorial called the Alley of Glory,
              constructed in 1961. The park is large, with 225 acres on a
              plateau which overlooks the Black Sea.

            <h2>Privoz</h2>
            <p>
              While not an attraction per se, adventurous types will enjoy a
              visit to Odessa's Privoz (Russian translation is 'Supply Place')
              which is an enormously sized outdoor / indoor market, which rivals
              those of Istanbul and Mexico City. During the days of Communism,
              Privoz was the only market that assured generous supply of every
              food type imaginable. Even though the Communist days are long
              over, Privoz remains a sight to see due to its massive size and
              array of products offered. It is fair to say, that anything can be
              found at Odessa's Privoz although to see it all may take hours.
              Privoz is located in Odessa's center, just a short walk away from
              the main train station.
